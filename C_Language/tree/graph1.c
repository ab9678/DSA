        why **head not *head or just simply head?
        Good question,
        Lets be clear, go above and look at the vetext structure, what do ya see?
        vertex has a field head, and its a struct node* type, here what is this *?,
        This star is declaring head as a pointer of type node.
        Now here in displayGraph, or createGraph function as well, we need a head pointer which will point to that head pointer. we could have done this by literally declaring the array as global and lietrally use array[i].head directly
        -- which I will be doing in a while,
        but we need something clean and that is why we are using a head pointer which will be pointing to the array[i].head pointer, and that's my friend is the pointer pointing to another pointer, which in other words, recall 1st semester, is DOUBLE POINTER.

        tl;dr
